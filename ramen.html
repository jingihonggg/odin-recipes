    <h3>Again, it isn't too difficult. <em>Breathe.</em> It'll be alright.</h3>
    <ul class="ingredients">
        <p>Again, you can mix and match or add whatever you want honestly in terms of meats and vegetables. The broth is going to most likely make it taste good anyway.</p>
        <li>Can of Tuna</li>
        <li>Raw Eggs</li>
        <li>Green Onions</li>
        <li>Mushrooms</li>
    </ul>
    <ol class="steps">
        <p>STEPS:</p>
        <li>1. Get a pot and fill it with water. Bring it to a boil</li>
        <li>2. Once the water is boiling, put the packet contents in it including the dried vegetable flakes and broth spice.</li>
        <li>3. Give it a stir and then put in the fried noodles along with your green onions and mushrooms.</li>
        <li>4. Once the noodles start getting a bit softer, crack a couple of raw eggs in there (or as many as you like) and don't fully cook it because slightly raw eggs taste divine.</li>
        <li>5. Optional: Eat with kimchi.</li>
